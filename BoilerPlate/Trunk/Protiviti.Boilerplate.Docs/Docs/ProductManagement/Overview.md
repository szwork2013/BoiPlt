Product Management Process Overview
========================

The product management process encompases all activities related 
to defining, prioritizing, estimating, and tracking the features 
that a team should build or has built for a products release.  Some
Agile Scrum processes rely on external systems \(like TFS & Jira\) 
to manage the features \(or User Stories\) a team needs to build. This
system relies on a Behavior Driven Development approach.  As such all
requirements are specified using feature and scenarios written in the
Gherkin format.
