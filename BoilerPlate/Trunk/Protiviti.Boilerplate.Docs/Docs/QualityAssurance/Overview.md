How to Generate Steps for a Specflow Scenario

1)	Once scenarios have been written and prioritized, a tester should start with creating the test steps for the “must” (must have) scenarios. 

2)	Selecting the default step definition style (regular expressions in attribute), click the option to generate step definitions. 

3)	In the Steps file, removing the default expression, add the methods, along with any additional code, such as Asserts, using the page pattern format: 
<p><b>[Page Name].[Action on the page]</b>.</p> 

See illustration below for further details.
