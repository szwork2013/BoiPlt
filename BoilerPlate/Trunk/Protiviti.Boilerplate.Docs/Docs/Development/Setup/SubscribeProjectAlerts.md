There are many situations when you want to monitor the progress of a build. Some examples include:

    You are a developer waiting for the outcome of a continuous integration or gated check-in build.

    You are a tester waiting for a build to be completed (including results from some automated test runs) so that you can begin manually testing the application.

There are other situations when you want to monitor check-ins made by your team members.

You can monitor your builds and check-ins by enabling email alerts, or by setting Team Foundation Server build notifications that are displayed on your notification area.

You can register one or more email addresses to receive email alerts when the following Team Foundation events occur in a given team project:

    My work items are changed by others

    Anything is checked in

    Any build completes

    My build completes

    A build quality changes

    A code review I am working on changes

To enable build / check-in notification e-mail alerts

    In Team Explorer:

        If you are not already connected to the team project that you want to work in, then connect to the team project.

        Choose Home icon Home, and then choose Settings icon Settings.

        On the Settings page, under Team Project, choose Project Alerts.

    Select one or more alert events.

    In the Send My Alerts To box, choose Edit and enter the email address of each person who should receive the alerts. Use semicolons to separate multiple email addresses.
