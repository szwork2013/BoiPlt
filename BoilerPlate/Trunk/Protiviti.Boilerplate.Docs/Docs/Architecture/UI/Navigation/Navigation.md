Navigation
===================================
## Overview ##
The application uses AngularUI Router (ui-router) for its UI navigation. AngularUI Router supports everything the normal AngularJS ngRoute provides with extra features.  The core of AngularUI Router is organizing the part of your interface into states, which corresponds to a "place" in the application, rather than organizing around URL routes. It's power lies in it's ability to handle nested views elegantly with minimal development overhead. Review the links below to learn about AngularJS routing and the 3rd party AnguarUI Router.

## Getting Started
1. Get UI-Router by:
    - downloading latest sources [here](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js) (or [minified](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.min.js))
    - via Package Manager Console by running 'Install-Package Angular-UI-Router'
2. Include angular-ui-router.js (or angular-ui-router.min.js) in your index.html, after including Angular itself 
3. Add 'ui.router' to your main module's list of dependencies (app.js)
