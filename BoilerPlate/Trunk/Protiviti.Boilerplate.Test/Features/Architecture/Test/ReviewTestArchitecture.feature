Feature: Review Test Architecture
	In order to understand how testing is handled in the solution
	As a team member
	I want to review documentation that explains systems architecture for defining and running tests

#Scenario: View the Test Architecture Overview
#	Given I am a team member
#	When I view the "README" markdown file
#  And I click the "Test" link in the "Solution Architecture" section
#  Then I should see the "Test Architecture" page
#  And I should see a "Overview" section
#  And the "Overview" section should "explain how tests are hosted and used in the solution"
#  And I should see a "Defining Features and Scenarios" section
#  And the "Defining Features and Scenarios" section should "explain how to define a features or scenarios in the solution"
#  And I should see a "Feature Types" section
#  And the "Feature Types" section should "explain how features can be used to define not only features that should be included in the solution but also documentation that needs to be created and tasks that need to be performed"
#  And the "Feature Types" section should include a list item with the text "Functional Features"
#  And the "Feature Types" section should include a list item with the text "Documentation Features"
#  And the "Feature Types" section should include a list item with the text "Task Features"
#  And I should see a "Resources" section
#  And the "Resources" section should contain the following links
#  | LinkText                    |
#  | Behavior Driven Development |
#  | Cucumber                    |
#  | SpecFlow                    |
#  | Gherkin - Behat             |
#  | Gherkin - Cucumber GitHub   |
#  And the page should be reviewed within the last "3" months
