Feature: Review the Backlog Prioritizing Process
	In order to understand the process and system for prioritizing features and scenarios
	As a team member
	I want to review documentaiton about priortizing features and scenarios

#Scenario: Review Backlog Prioritization Process Overview
	#Given I am a team member
	#When I view the "README" markdown file
  #And I click the "Product Management" link
  #And I click the "Backlog Priortization" link
  #Then I should see the "Backlog Priortization" page
  #And I should see a "Priotizing Features and Scenarios" section
  #And the "Priotizing Features and Scenarios" section should "explain how features and scenarios are priortized using MoSCoW prioritization"
  #And I should see a "Viewing the Backlog Prioritizations" section
  #And the "Viewing the Backlog Prioritizations" section should "explain how review the prioritization of the features and scenarios"
  #And I should see an "Additional Resources" section
  #And the "Additional Resources" section should "provide a list of links to information that would explain MoSCoW priortization."
